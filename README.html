# The Agent-Friendly Web

I'm On a Mission To Make The Open Internet Agent-Friendly through URLs (Universal Resource Locators). All below websites
are mirrors (some better, some worse) that allow accessing the information from the website in a token-dense format
(usually Markdown).

- Google - https://googllm.com
- GitHub - https://uithub.com
- NPMJS - https://npmjz.com
- Cloudflare Dashboard - https://flaredream.com
- APIs - https://openapisearch.com
- X - https://xymake.com
- LLM - https://lmpify.com
- ArXiv (Papers) - https://arxivmd.org
- YouTube - https://youtudo.com (Unstable)
- Aggregated - https://llmtext.com (Unstable)

Now that we have the URL back to what is was meant for, now for LLMs, we can use it directly in our interfaces for
context building. I've build https://contextarea.com to demonstrate this, and it's first application where it can be
used is https://lmpify.com

I believe that building with these principles will create a more open, more connected, and ultimately, better internet.
One with a shared interface that is browsable by humans as well as agents.

I'm using Cloudflare to deploy everything. They have everything I need.

Useful Build Patterns:

- How Agents Store Information - https://getdorm.com
- How Agents Identify - https://smootherauth.com
- How Agents Pay - https://github.com/janwilmake/stripeflare
- Agent-Friendly Web Principles - https://github.com/janwilmake/user-agent-router
- Bringing it together - https://github.com/janwilmake/user-agent-402


Personal Experiments:

- Move To The Web - https://github.com/janwilmake/onlybrowse

There's much more in my GitHub at https://github.com/janwilmake although it's a bit less organised. You can also check
out https://lists.forgithub.com/janwilmake for lists I keep track of.

If you like my mission, you can support me by sharing it, using the products, and helping me to find more applications
of
it.
Some are
not all that bad!
