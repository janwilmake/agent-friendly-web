# The Agent-Friendly Web

I'm On a Mission To Make The Open Internet Agent-Friendly through URLs (Universal Resource Locators). All below websites
are mirrors (some better, some worse) that allow accessing the information from the website in a token-dense format
(usually Markdown).

- Google - https://googllm.com
- GitHub - https://uithub.com
- NPMJS - https://npmjz.com
- Cloudflare Dashboard - https://flaredream.com
- APIs - https://openapisearch.com
- X - https://xymake.com
- LLM - https://lmpify.com
- ArXiv (Papers) - https://arxivmd.org
- YouTube - https://youtudo.com (Unstable)
- Aggregated - https://llmtext.com (Unstable)

I believe that building with these principles will create a more open, more connected, and ultimately, better internet.
One with a shared interface that is browsable by humans as well as agents.

I'm using Cloudflare to deploy everything. They have everything I need.
